# Why do we need the Self-healing SIG?

Note:

If we have all these great projects, why do we need the SIG?

<img alt="Mess of integration points"

        />

Note:

We tried to collect all the available integration points between the
different projects and visualise them, and we got this, which is
obviously really hard to translate into real-world deployments which
achieve actual self-healing use cases.

# Challenges

*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    [**Lots** of potential integration points](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/self-healing-project-integrations)
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    Very little documentation
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    Very little guidance for operators
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    No coherent architectural vision across OpenStack

### <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> We can do better!
